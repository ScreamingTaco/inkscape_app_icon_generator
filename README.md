# Inkscpae App Icon Generator

*Note*: I have been away from this project for a long time, but I am looking to be more active in mainting it going forward. Please
be patient with me as I get up-to-speed on all the changes that have been introduced into inkscape in the past few years. PRs welcome!

I got tired of having to manually export different icon size when I made an icon in inkscape, so I made this plugin to automate it

## TODO

* Test Windows support 
* refactor the python code to comply with pep8
* add option to specify custom path to save to
* clean up output
* investigate res folder issues
* check if there's been updates to app store requirements in the few years since this was written
* move things from TODO to actual issues (once they have been investigated)
* investigate the warnings this script generates and see if they can be removed
