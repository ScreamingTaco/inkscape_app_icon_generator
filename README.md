# Inkscpae App Icon Generator

*Note*: I have been away from this project for a long time, but I am looking to be more active in mainting it going forward. Please
be patient with me as I get up-to-speed on all the changes that have been introduced into inkscape in the past few years. PRs welcome!

I got tired of having to manually export different icon size when I made an icon in inkscape, so I made this plugin to automate it

## TODO

* Add Windows support (maybe done now?)
* Add tests to make sure the icon meets the standards for whatever app store it is being designed for
* refactor the python code to use subprocesses
* add option to specify custom path to save to
* clean up output
